## General Introduction

2/4/25:

Getting back into things, specifically trying to apply to actuarial positions with my new-and-improved actuarial background. Recall how my last sat (and passed) exam, PA, was all about 'data science' - and quite heavy in the mathematics side of it. And, my prime frustration being, "Why would we have to analyze code when we're not coders?" Albeit I still think R is quite cumbersome, we're at least coders now. So, let us be on our way!

## Dataset Introduction

From Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e12/):

Your Goal: The objectives of this challenge is to predict insurance premiums based on various factors.

Dataset Description
The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Insurance Premium Prediction dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

Files
train.csv - the training dataset; Premium Amount is the continuous target
test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict target Premium Amount for each row
sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
